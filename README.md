WHAT IS HACKTOOLS?

Hacktools is a collection of fictional hacking and cybersecurity tools for use in Live Roleplay Games.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Well... nothing really.

The repository is hosted as a GitHub Page so it is a Static Web Host. 
This means that if you navigate to:

https://gandalfslair.github.io/hacktools

you should be presented with the index.html file which will allow you to access the various tools on any browser with internet access.

(If that proves problematic you can try:

https://gandalfslair.github.io/hacktools/index.html

and that might/should work. Any issues please let me know)

The individual files for each seperate tool can be found at:

https://github.com/GandalfsLair/fictional-tools_as_HackerTypers

Go. Have fun!
